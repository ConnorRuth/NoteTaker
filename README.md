## Description
I would like users to be able to save and delete notes in an online app.

## Installation
Requires nodejs to be installed and to run npm i to install uuid and express or if looking for the online note taker follow this link: https://secure-everglades-65711-757b2dc829f2.herokuapp.com/notes

## Usage
Once the user has opened up the website they will be introduced to the home screen:

they can fill the note area with a title and text in the text span as long as any text is inside the note area they can press the button in the top left to clear out the note. If both areas have been filled out the user can save the note putting it on the side accessible to the user where they can also be deleted with the red trash can
